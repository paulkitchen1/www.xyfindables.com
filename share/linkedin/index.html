            With the passage of the "JOBS act", and recent changes to the laws regarding investment opportunities, companies now have the ability
            to give un-accredited investors the chance to invest in companies. XY Findables is taking this groundbreaking opportunity to forego
            the traditional road of VC funding, and offer the opportunity to become an owner of the company to anyone.  Where traditional
            funding would force us to always focus on short term profits, this type of opportunity can instead give XY Findables the chance to keep working on
            creating products that are less harmful to the environment, grow our community of owners and users, and better fulfill our mission of making everything
            Findable. To Reserve your shares now, click the link below and learn more about how you can Find it, Fund it, and Own it with XY.

          No money or other consideration is being solicited, and if sent in response to XY Findables, will not be accepted. No offer to buy the securities of
           XY Findables can be accepted and no part of the purchase price can be received until the offering statement filed by XY Findables with the SEC
           has been qualified by the SEC. Any such offer to buy securities may be withdrawn or revoked, without obligation of any kind, at any time before notice
           of its acceptance is given after the date of qualification. An indication of interest in XY Findables’ offering involves no obligation or commitment
           of any kind.
          <br />
          These materials may contain forward-looking statements and if information relating to, among other things, XY Findables, its business plan and
          strategy, and its industry. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of, assumptions made by, and information currently available
          to XY Findables' management. When used in the offering materials, the words "estimate," "project," "believe," "anticipate," "intend," "expect," and
          similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which constitute forward-looking statements. The statements reflect
          management's current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause XY Findables' actual results to
          differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
          statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. XY Findables does not undertake any obligation to revise or update these forward-looking
          statements to reflect events or circumstances after such date or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
          <br />
          XY Findables is "Testing the Waters" under Regulation A under the Securities Act of 1933. This process allows companies to determine whether there
          may be interest in an eventual offering of its securities. XY Findables is not under any obligation to make an offering under Regulation A. It
          may choose to make an offering to some, but not all, of the people who indicate an interest in investing, and that offering might not be made
          under Regulation A. If XY Findables does go ahead with an offering, it will only be able to make sales after it has filed an offering statement with
          The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the SEC has "qualified" the offering statement. The information in that offering statement will be
          more complete than the information XY Findables is providing now, and could differ in important ways. You must read the documents filed.
