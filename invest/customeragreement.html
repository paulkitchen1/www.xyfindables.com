        <h1>JumpStart Securities Agreement</h1>

        <p>To effect the securities transactions you are making, even though “self-directed”, you are hereby appointing JumpStart Securities, LLC (“JumpStart”, “us”, “our”, “we”, “Firm”) as your accommodating broker. JumpStart is an SEC registered, FINRA
            member, SIPC insured broker-dealer that is registered in your state of residence. We specialize in effecting self-directed securities transactions. We do not and will not reach out to you to suggest, advise or recommend any securities (in
            other words, no sales people will bug you, ever). This Agreement (“Agreement”) governs all aspects of your relationship with JumpStart. <strong>YOU AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AS FOLLOWS:</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>True and Accurate Information; Ownership</h3>
                <p>You certify and represent that all information you provided in your investing details (meaning the name and title in which your securities are recorded on the books and records of the issuer(s) and their designated transfer agent, if any
                    and statement of accreditation are all true, complete, current and accurate and that JumpStart may rely on these statements and the self-attestations and representations that you made. You agree to indemnify and hold JumpStart and
                    our affiliates harmless from and against any and all loss, liability, cost, damage, charge, expense or fee (including attorneys’ fees and costs of collection) of any nature whatsoever, and claims therefore (collectively, “losses”)
                    arising out of or relating to your failure to provide true, current, complete and/or accurate information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Fiduciary Accounts</h3>
                <p>JumpStart does not review any action or inaction of a Fiduciary with respect to any transaction(s) therein and we are not responsible for determining whether a Fiduciary’s action or inaction satisfies the standard of care applicable to
                    such Fiduciary’s handling of a transaction. JumpStart is not responsible for determining the validity of a person or entity’s status or capacity to serve as a Fiduciary.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Self-Directed Transactions</h3>
                <p>Your transactions which JumpStart executes on your behalf are “self-directed”, which means that we execute securities transactions only upon your request and at your direction; you make all investment decisions. As a self-directed investor,
                    you assume full, complete and sole responsibility for each and every transaction you order and for your investment strategies and decisions. You understand and agree that JumpStart and our affiliates will have no rights to or liability
                    whatsoever for the results, including any gains or losses, of your investment strategies and decisions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>No Advice</h3>
                <p>JumpStart does not and will not provide you with any investment, legal, tax, estate planning or accounting advice or securities recommendations. JumpStart does not and will not provide you with any advice or recommendations regarding the
                    suitability, profitability or appropriateness for you of any security, investment, financial product, investment strategy or other matter. You acknowledge that JumpStart employees are not authorized to give any advice or make any recommendations
                    and you agree that you will not consider any communications to be investment advice from JumpStart or any of our officers, directors, employees or agents and in no event will any communication be construed or interpreted by you or
                    any other person as advice or as a recommendation that you buy, sell or hold any particular security or pursue any particular investment strategy. You also acknowledge that JumpStart neither had any role in creating and/or drafting,
                    and assumes absolutely no responsibility for nor guarantees the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of information, commentary, research, statistics, marketing materials, advertisements, information posted to issuer websites and/or
                    other websites, press or media announcements, opinions, offering documents, prospectuses, private placement memorandums, offering disclosures or other materials that you may review and ultimately rely on in making your decisions, by
                    or through any means including but not limited to websites (e.g. platforms), emails, and social media, regarding any offering of securities, whether original issuance or secondary market. If you choose to rely on such information you
                    accept and unconditionally agree that you do so solely at your own risk. That JumpStart or its employees or representatives may have had an opportunity to see or review such materials, even if we have been alerted to potential problems
                    with them, does not in any way imply that we have vetted or endorsed the securities, nor does it constitute any form of a recommendation or advice, and you agree that JumpStart is under absolutely no obligation to communicate, disseminate
                    or proactively undertake any examination of such securities or materials, nor to warn, alert or prevent you or anyone else from making decisions to purchase or sell any securities. That at times we may initiate actions regarding such
                    information does not in any way imply that we will always do so, nor modify this Agreement such that it could be interpreted that we accept any liability or responsibility for doing so for any other securities or even for those same
                    securities at other times.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Responsibility for Orders</h3>
                <p>All orders for the purchase and sale of securities are originated, directed and/or authorized by you and executed in reliance on your representation, action and promise that an actual purchase or sale is intended. You understand JumpStart
                    may at any time, in our sole discretion and without prior notice to you, prohibit or restrict your ability to purchase or sell securities. In no event will JumpStart be obligated to effect any transaction we believe, in our sole and
                    arbitrary discretion, even if unverified and without involving legal counsel, that such transaction <em>may</em> in any way violate any federal or state law, rule or regulation or the rules or regulations of any regulatory or self-regulatory
                    body; and when and where we decline to effect any transaction we are under no obligation to inform you or any other person of such declination, nor to provide any reason or substantiation for such declination, and will not be held
                    responsible for any problems with such declination including but not limited to lost opportunities, lost profits, lost participation interests, or other lost or forgone benefits that you or others might otherwise have received had
                    the effecting of the transaction(s) not been declined by us.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Liquidity of Private and Non-Exchange Traded Securities</h3>
                <p>You hereby represent and warrant that you understand that investments in the equity or debt securities of private and/or non-exchange traded securities are generally illiquid and that you may not be able to sell them and may have to hold
                    them indefinitely. You also understand that investments in the equity and/or debt securities of such private and/or non-exchange listed companies are risky and you may lose some or all of you principal, as well as any expected returns
                    or benefits, and that you are both aware of the risks and prepared and capable of sustaining any and all losses, including the loss of your entire investment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Due Diligence</h3>
                <p>You hereby represent and warrant that you have conducted your own due diligence on all securities that you are investing in, you are satisfied with your due diligence, and you are not relying on any due diligence efforts of JumpStart.
                    That JumpStart may have undertaken or engaged in some due diligence tasks, such as running OFAC checks on or requesting documents from the issuer or performing a cursory review of offering materials and disclosures, this shall not
                    constitute or be interpreted to mean that JumpStart has performed any meaningful, professional due diligence upon which any investor may rely, including you, and we make absolutely no warranty’s or representations regarding the accuracy,
                    adequacy or completeness of any such activities we perform, if we perform any. Rather, as your investments are self-directed and not solicited or recommended by JumpStart; you agree to perform for yourself all of the due diligence
                    on each investment you make and rely exclusively on your own efforts. JumpStart has not made any recommendations nor provided you with any due diligence materials or investment advice on any transaction or security. You are making
                    self-directed investments which JumpStart is processing as the accommodating securities broker on your behalf. You agree never to hold JumpStart, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, contractors or agents responsible, accountable
                    or in any way liable for any losses or problems, even when a loss occurs as a result of fraud or other malfeasance by third parties which you or others believe may have been reasonably discernable by us.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Risk Profile of Investments</h3>
                <p>The SEC and other regulators, as well as common sense, generally deem all private and non-exchange traded securities to be “high risk”. As such, you hereby represent and warrant that you are fully informed and aware of the risks of investing
                    in these types of securities and will be held solely and exclusively accountable for the decisions and choices you make. Furthermore, you hereby represent and warrant that you understand that the risk profile of such securities means
                    that you may lose some or all of your principal, as well as never realize part or all of the returns you anticipated, and that you are both comfortable with and capable of bearing and sustaining such loses without recourse. No securities
                    effected through JumpStart are in any way insured, guaranteed or without risk.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>No Legal, Tax or Accounting Advice</h3>
                <p>You agree without reservation that JumpStart has not, does not and will not provide any legal, tax or accounting advice in any way, nor on any matter, regardless of the tone or content of any communication (oral, written or otherwise).
                    You unconditionally agree to rely solely on your legal, tax and accounting professionals for any such advice and on all matters.</p>

                <p>You agree that this Agreement is governed by, and will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflict of laws.</p>

                    officers directors, employees, associates or agents, arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement, or any service provided by us, including transactions of any kind made on your behalf through us, shall be resolved by Financial Industry
                    Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitration, in accordance with FINRA’s Code of Arbitration Procedure. If you are not a resident of the U.S. at the time a controversy subject to arbitration arises, you agree that any arbitration hearing
                    shall be held in New York City, New York; you consent to the personal jurisdiction of all courts located in the State of New York for purposes of enforcing this arbitration agreement and any arbitration award; and you agree that any

                    clause. By signing this Agreement the parties agree as follows:</p>

                <ol id="fa-customer-agreement-arbitration">
                    <li>All parties to this agreement are giving up the right to sue each other in court, including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the arbitration forum in which a claim is filed.</li>
                    <li>Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party’s ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited.</li>
                    <li>The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings.</li>
                    <li>The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award unless, in an eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all parties to the panel at least 20 days prior to the first scheduled
                        hearing date.</li>
                    <li>The panel of arbitrators may include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry.</li>
                    <li>The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in arbitration. In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in court.</li>
                    <li>The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any amendments thereto, shall be incorporated into this agreement.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration, nor seek to enforce any pre-dispute arbitration agreement against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action; or who is a member of a putative
                    class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class action until: (i) the class certification is denied; or (ii) the class is decertified; or (iii) the customer is excluded from the
                    class by the court. Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under this agreement except to the extent stated herein.</p>

                <p>You hereby consent to this method of dispute resolution, as well as jurisdiction and waive any right you may have to object to either the method or jurisdiction for such claim or dispute. In the event of any dispute among the parties,
                    the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover damages plus reasonable attorney’s fees, and the decision of the arbitrator shall be final, binding and enforceable in any court.</p>

                        <p>Digital (“electronic”) signatures, often referred to as an “e-signature”, enable paperless contracts and help speed up business transactions. The 2001 E-Sign Act was meant to ease the adoption of electronic signatures. You hereby
                            agree and consent that your intentional action in electronically signing this Agreement by clicking the “I AGREE” checkbox is the legal equivalent of your manually signing this Agreement and you will be legally bound by its
                            terms and conditions. The use of an electronic version of any documents or communications satisfies any requirement that they be provided to you in writing. You are solely responsible for reviewing and understanding all of
                            the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any current or future documents. You hereby consent and agree that electronically signing this Agreement constitutes your signature, acceptance and agreement as if actually signed
                            by you in writing. Further, you agree that no certification authority or other third party verification is necessary to validate any electronic signature; and that the lack of such certification or third party verification
                            will not in any way affect the enforceability of your signature or resulting contract between you and JumpStart. You understand and agree that your e-signature executed in conjunction with the electronic submission of this
                            Agreement shall be legally binding. Furthermore, you agree that all current and future notices, confirmations and other communications regarding this Agreement specifically, and your transactions in general will be made by
                            email, sent to the email address of record as provided by you to us when ordering a transaction, without necessity of confirmation of receipt, delivery or reading, and such form of electronic communication is sufficient for
                            all matters regarding the relationship between the parties. If any such electronically-sent communication fails to be received for any reason, including but not limited to such communications being diverted to the recipients’
                            spam filters, or by errors or policies of the recipients email service provider, or due to a recipients’ change of address, or due to technology issues by the recipients’ service provider, you agree that the burden of such
                            failure to receive is on you as the recipient, and not JumpStart as the sender, and that the sender is under no obligation to resend communications via any other means, including but not limited to postal service or overnight
                            courier, and that such communications shall for all purposes, including legal and regulatory, be deemed to have been delivered and received. No physical, paper documents will be sent to you, and if you desire physical documents
                            then you agree to be satisfied by directly and personally printing, at your own expense, the electronically-sent communication(s) and maintaining such physical records in any manner or form that you desire.</p>

                            effectiveness or validity of this Agreement or of any electronic communication provided while your consent was in effect.</p>

                <p>This Agreement may be amended, altered or modified only by an instrument in writing specifying such amendment, alteration or modification, which is executed by both parties. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be held
                    by a court, arbitral or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible by applicable law and the remaining portions of this Agreement shall remain in
                    full force and effect and enforceable.</p>
