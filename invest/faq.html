            What is Regulation A+ Crowdfunding?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Title IV (Regulation A+) of 2012’s JOBS Act allows privately-held companies to sell shares to the public, very much like a traditional IPO. These shares can be sold to both accredited and non-accredited investors.In short, Reg A+ gives companies like XY Findables the ability to offer early stage ownership to customers, supporters, or any other individual. Learn more <a href="https://university.xyfindables.com/what-is-reg-a-c87fbd78b6ed" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <p class="question">
            What are the rules for investing?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Anyone can invest up to 10% of their net worth, or 10% of their annual net income, whichever is greater. If you are an “accredited investor,” you can invest as much as you like, assuming there are enough shares left in the round to purchase.

        <p class="question">
            What are the risks?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Buying XY Findables equity is higher risk (and hopefully higher reward) than a major stock on the NYSE. The odds of us going out of business is higher than Apple, but the odds of us growing 2x, 3x, or 10x is also higher. When it comes to Reg A+ offerings, the important thing to do is read the circular, do your own research on the product and market, and decide if this is something that you want to invest in and feel has the risk profile that works for you. <a href="https://university.xyfindables.com/what-are-the-risks-of-investing-in-a-reg-a-offering-like-xy-findables-c90b0cff751a" target="_blank">Learn More</a>.

        <p class="question">
            How long does it take to get a return on my investment?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            An investment in XY Findables is a multi-year endeavor not a short term one. There are three basic possible outcomes from this, or any other Regulation A+ investment.
        </p>
        <ol style="margin-top:-20px">
            <li>IPO —  We do a full IPO and join a public exchange like the NASDAQ or NYSE.</li>
            <li>Sale/Acquisition — We sell the company to a larger company or large investment firm.</li>
            <li>Company Fails — This would mean that your investment (along with ours) has been lost.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="answer">
            The important thing is that your stock is valued the same way as ours, The XY Team, so we all either win or lose together. <a href="https://university.xyfindables.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-return-on-my-investment-what-is-the-exit-plan-for-xy-findables-277de0e93368" target="_blank">Learn More</a>.

        <p class="question">
            Why is XY Findables Raising Money?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Even though XY Findables has grown substantially since it was founded in 2012, XY is not yet profitable. We have prioritized growth over profit and to that end, our CEO has put millions of his own dollars at risk. As we grow, the cost of manufacturing larger and larger quantities, innovating new products, and expanding our marketing and sales effort all take considerable additional investment. <a href="https://university.xyfindables.com/why-is-xy-findables-raising-money-b6022ba30981" target="_blank">Learn More</a>. about why we chose Regulation A+ as our investment vehicle.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            Is XY Findables a public company?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Yes, XY Findables is a “public company”, very similar to ones you would see on the NYSE or NASDAQ, but Reg A+ (Title IV) does make some allowances for the fact that most Reg A+ companies are smaller. We only have to submit a public filing twice a year instead of four times a year. However, the annual financials are still required to be audited, just like a traditional “IPO” company. Find out <a href="https://university.xyfindables.com/is-xy-findables-a-public-company-and-does-it-have-to-follow-the-same-rules-as-other-public-c5efa008b7e8" target="_blank">more</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            How can I sell my XY Findables Stock?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Stock that comes from a Reg A+ public offering is more liquid than a typical investment in a public company, but not as liquid as stock in a company that is publicly trade on an exchange, such as the NASDAQ or NYSE.Until we are listed on an exchange, over the counter or traditional, the only way to sell or transfer your stock is through our transfer agent.

        <p class="question">
            Can I buy more shares after my first investment?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Every purchase of shares from a Reg A+ is treated as a new transaction and can only be done while the offering is still open. This means that you can buy a second or third helping of shares if you would like, as long as you conform to the SEC Reg A+ guidelines and don’t go over your 10% of annual salary or net worth limit.

        <p class="question">
            What are the tax implications for buying stock in a Regulation A+?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            For income tax purposes, the funds are treated as paid-in capital for the company, and neither the company nor the purchaser is subject to taxation at the time of the purchase. Tax implications arise for the purchaser of equity only when the purchased shares are sold. These capital gains and losses will be reported with IRS Form 8949 and IRS Form 1040. <a href="https://university.xyfindables.com/what-are-the-tax-considerations-for-buying-stock-in-a-reg-a-like-xy-findables-fba395960d29" target="_blank">Learn more</a>

It is not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for, tax, legal or accounting advice.

            What’s a subscription agreement and why does it require my signature?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            The subscription agreement is the agreement all investors sign. It lists the shares you are purchasing and the responsibilities you, as an investor, and XY-The Findables Company have toward each other.
            <br /><br />
            Each investor is emailed a copy of the agreement for an electronic signature when they purchase their shares. If you did not receive this email, please check your spam folder. If you cannot locate the email you can request a new copy of the agreement be emailed to you.
            <br /><br />
            To request a new copy of your agreement log in to the Insider Club Portal and click on the Transaction History tab. At the bottom you will see the following:
            <br /><br />

            What is the investment package?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            The investment package is a thank you gift we send to all of our investors once their subscription agreement is signed. It contains printed copies of your signed agreement and your stock certificate, as well as a custom investor XY Bluetooth Finder, a cable key tether and replacement batteries.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            Why haven’t I received my investment package in the mail yet?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            We mail out new batches of investment packages each week. You will receive an email when your package is shipped. They typically arrive within 2-3 business days.
            <br /><br />
            If you do not receive your package within 2 weeks of investing it could be for one of two reasons:
            <br /><br />
            1. An unsigned subscription agreement.
            <br /><br />
            We only send packages once the agreement is signed. If you haven’t signed your agreement yet please log in to your Insider Club Portal to request a new copy to be sent to you for signature.
            <br /><br />
            2. An incomplete or invalid address
            <br /><br />
            If you did not input your full address, including an apartment or unit number, when you invested we are unable to mail your package to you. To verify that your address is current and correct please log in to your Insider Club Portal and click on the Profile tab. You can edit your contact information and mailing address here. Be sure to hit the green save button when you’re done, otherwise your changes will not be recorded.

        <p class="question">
            I want to add a joint investor to my account. How can I do it?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            You can add a second person to your account as a Joint Investor via your Insider Club Portal. Log in and go to the Transaction History page. Scroll down to Members and click + Add Member.  Fill out the name and contact information of the person you wish to add. When finished click the green Add Joint Account button at the bottom.
            <br /><br />

(It is emailed to you, as the primary investor first, once you sign it, it is forwarded to your joint investor for signature). Once both of you have signed the agreement it supersedes your original, individual agreement. Within 3 days both you and your joint investor will be able to  log on to your respective Investor Portals to view and download a copy.

            As stated on the certificate “This stock certificate is not a security instrument, has no value and does not reflect actual ownership of shares. The number of shares owned, if any, is reflected on the stock ledger of XY-The Findables Company.”   In other words, this is a ceremonial certificate only. It’s not like losing a 100 dollar bill!  The official record of your shares is kept in our electronic database including your signed subscription agreement.
