    "question": "Why can I invest now?",
    "answer": "Easy answer: Because the government lets us sell you shares! Startups are normally legally required to go to millionaires, literally a person with at least a 6-figure salary, for investments in their company. We went through a 6-month audit for an exemption from this rule. Now, it’s your turn to invest in a startup and see potentially huge returns."

    "question": "What does this investment mean for me?",

  {
    "question": "How do I make money?",
    "answer": "Right now, our shares are mini-IPO, meaning they aren’t traded on the public stock market. We are hoping to IPO in the next 2-3 years, and at that point, you’ll be able to sell your stocks on the regulated market. Normally when a company IPOs, the stock can be around $15-$30, which already is a huge return! Sometimes, they can even trade higher!"
