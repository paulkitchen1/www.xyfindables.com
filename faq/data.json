    "question": "Why can I invest now?",
    "answer": "Easy answer: Because the government lets us sell you shares! Startups normally go to millionaires, literally a person with at least a 6-figure salary, for investments in their company. We, on the other hand, went through a 6-month audit for qualification to sell our Pre-IPO stock to the public at large. Now, it’s your turn to invest in a startup and see potentially huge returns."

  {
    "question": "What does this investment mean for me?",
    "answer": "This investment is your opportunity to get to the future you’ve always wanted. Ever worried about something in the future? The future of your family? Your kids? Investing in a startup means you can make changes in your financials today that can affect your future forever."

  {
    "question": "What do I get?",
    "answer": "When you become an investor, you receive exclusive access to the XY Investor Store, where they can see our newest products and buy them at a reduced cost. You will receive SEC documents by email, as well as a stock certificate with your name in the mail."

  {
    "question": "How do I make money?",
    "answer": "Right now, our shares are mini-IPO, meaning they aren’t traded on the public stock market. We are hoping to IPO in the next 2-3 years, and at that point, you’ll be able to sell your stocks on the regulated market. Normally when a company IPOs, the stock can be around $15-$30, which already is a huge return! Sometimes, they can even trade higher!"

  {
    "question": "What is Regulation A+ Crowdfunding?",
    "answer": "Title IV (Regulation A+) of 2012’s JOBS Act allows privately-held companies to sell shares to the public, very much like a traditional IPO. These shares can be sold to both accredited and non-accredited investors.In short, Reg A+ gives companies like XY Findables the ability to offer early stage ownership to customers, supporters, or any other individual."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the risks?",
    "answer": "Buying XY Findables equity is higher risk (and hopefully higher reward) than a major stock on the NYSE. The odds of us going out of business is higher than Apple, but the odds of us growing 2x, 3x, or 10x is also higher. When it comes to Reg A+ offerings, the important thing to do is read the circular, do your own research on the product and market, and decide if this is something that you want to invest in and feel has the risk profile that works for you."
