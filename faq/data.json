    "question": "Why can I invest now?",
    "answer": "Easy answer: Because the government lets us sell you shares! Startups normally go to high net-worth people, called accredited investors, for investments in their company. We, on the other hand, went through a 6-month 3rd party audit as part of the SEC qualification process to sell our pre-IPO stock to the public at large. Now, it’s your turn to invest in a startup at an earlier stage then before."

  {
    "question": "What do I get?",
    "answer": "When you become an investor, you receive exclusive access to the XY Investor store, where you can see our newest products and buy them at a reduced cost. You will receive your Subscription Agreement by email, as well as a stock certificate with your name in the mail."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I make money?",
    "answer": "Right now, our shares are mini-IPO, meaning they aren’t traded on the public stock market. We are hoping to pursue an IPO in the next 2-4 years, and at that point, you’ll be able to sell your stocks on the regulated market. In the case of the company being acquired before then, you would receive the share price at which the company was sold."

  {
    "question": "What is Regulation A+ Crowdfunding?",
    "answer": "Title IV (Regulation A+) of 2012’s JOBS Act allows privately-held companies to sell shares to the public, very much like a traditional IPO. These shares can be sold to both accredited and non-accredited investors.In short, Reg A+ gives companies like XY Findables the ability to offer early stage ownership to customers, supporters, or any other individual."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the risks?",
    "answer": "Buying XY Findables equity is higher risk (and hopefully higher reward) than a major stock on the NYSE. The odds of us going out of business is higher than Apple, but the odds of us growing 2x, 3x, or 10x is also higher. When it comes to Reg A+ offerings, the important thing to do is read the circular, do your own research on the product and market, and decide if this is something that you want to invest in and feel has the risk profile that works for you."
